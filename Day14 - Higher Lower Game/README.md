## Introduction
Welcome to Day 14 of 100 Days of Code. Today, you will be building an exciting game called Higher or Lower. This game has two main versions:

1. **Classic Version**: Players compare the average monthly Google searches of two search terms.
2. **Instagram Followers Version**: Players compare the number of Instagram followers between two accounts.

## Classic Version
In the classic version of Higher or Lower, players are presented with two search terms. For example, "The Grand Budapest Hotel" (a movie) and "AFL" (American Football League). The player must guess whether the second search term has higher or lower average monthly searches on Google compared to the first term. If the player guesses correctly, they proceed to the next comparison. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess, at which point their score is displayed.

## Instagram Followers Version
In the updated version of the game, players compare the number of Instagram followers between two accounts. For example, Neymar (a footballer from Brazil) vs. Chloe Kardashian (a reality TV personality and businesswoman from the US). The player guesses which account has more followers. The game proceeds similarly to the classic version, with the player continuing as long as their guesses are correct. The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess, and their score is shown.

## Objectives
- Develop a functional version of the Higher or Lower game.
- Implement both the classic and Instagram followers versions of the game.
- Ensure user interaction for making selections and receiving feedback.
- Utilize data handling for the game’s dataset of entities.
- Incorporate a scoring system that tracks and displays the player's score.
- Create a modular code structure with separate files for game logic, data handling, and user interface elements.

## Key Components
1. **User Interaction**: Players need to be able to make selections and receive immediate feedback on their choices.
2. **Data Handling**: The game must use a dataset containing information about various entities (names, follower counts, descriptions, countries) for comparisons.
3. **Randomization**: Comparisons should involve randomly selected entities to maintain engagement.
4. **Scoring System**: Track and display the number of correct guesses as the player’s score.
5. **Code Structure**: Ensure a modular approach with separate files for different aspects of the game, such as art assets, game data, and logic.

## Challenges
- Understanding game mechanics through repeated play to grasp rules and nuances.
- Breaking down the development process into manageable tasks, such as generating random numbers, importing necessary modules, and constructing comparison lines.
- Debugging and testing the code to ensure correct functionality and an enjoyable user experience.

## Goals
- Develop a fully functional version of the Higher or Lower game.
- Enhance problem-solving and programming skills through iterative coding, testing, and debugging.
- Apply learned concepts in a practical and engaging project to solidify programming knowledge.

## Conclusion
Your task is to code the Higher or Lower game entirely by yourself. Apply everything you have learned so far, understand the game by playing it multiple times, and write the code from scratch. You will need to debug and test your code thoroughly. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, and tackle them one by one. This project will challenge you, but it will also significantly strengthen your programming skills. Good luck!
